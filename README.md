# Calisthenic Routines Viewer

> A simple website to easy view Calisthenic routines

## Reason

The biggest reason to create this project was the crap quality to the website which contains those image, specially when you're accessing by a smartphone.

Then I decided to just create a static website grouping all those routines and mobile-friendly.
